# Genetic-Algorithm-Neural-Network-Weight-Optimization


Optimizing the weights in simple three layer neural network by turning on and off 10X1000 weights. Similar to dropout, the code tries to find the best score which turns off the weights the most. The main purpose is to obtain 99% of the original accuracy with the dropped weights.





-	population_size = 50

-	chromosome_length = 10000

-	tournament_size = 2

-	mutation_rate = 0.2

-	crossover_rate = 1.0

-	max_generations = 200



- Could change the initial value for better search
